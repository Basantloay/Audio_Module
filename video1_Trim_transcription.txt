when I was 10 years old we travel from Colorado to New Jersey to visit relatives at Christmas time we did a host of a variety of things that I actually get to see the original casts in the wizards and did a lot of sites saying but one of my favourite moment was to stay up late at night wait till everyone else has gone to bed and then I would sneak downstairs to watch television host of old movies that probably had no business watching such as Bonnie and Clyde and Oklahoma that was a little ok but I remember one evening come across a show it was an old movie and it must have been White Christmas or holiday in a bit type but it was a musical and I started watching and then they started to do this musical sane and I noticed I saw Bing Crosby in Blackface and I was confused like I couldn't quite understand what the black face had to do with the singing and dancing that was my introduction to Black
