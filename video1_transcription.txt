When I was 10 years old, we travel from Colorado to New Jersey, to visit relatives at Christmas time. We did a host of a variety of things. If I actually got to see the original cast in The Wiz and did a lot of sightseeing, but one of my favorite moments was to stay up late at night and wait till everyone else has gone to bed. And then I would sneak downstairs to watch television host of old movies, that probably had no business watching, such as Bonnie and Clyde, and Oklahoma, that was a little, okay? But I remember when he didn't come across the show me with an old movie and it must have been White Christmas or Holiday Inn of that type. But it was a musical and I started watching and then they started to do this musical scene and I noticed I saw Bing Crosby in blackface and I, I was confused, like, I couldn't quite understand what the black face.
